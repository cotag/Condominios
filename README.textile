h1. Condominios

A Rails plugin that makes direct uploads to multiple cloud storage providers easy.
Only supports "XMLHttpRequest Level 2":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest capable browsers and cloud providers that have a "RESTful API":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer with "CORS":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing support.

Why compromise?
