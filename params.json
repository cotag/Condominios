It avoids the pitfalls of large file uploads that would otherwise pass-through an application instance or the need for a third party service.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gem install condo\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ruby\r\n\r\nCondo utilises the features of Ruby 1.9.x (compatible Rubies) and Rails 3.x\r\n\r\n\r\n### Browser\r\n\r\nCondo only works with browsers that support [XMLHttpRequest Level 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest)\r\n\r\nWe like it this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cloud Storage\r\n\r\nWe are building drivers for providers that\r\n\r\n1. Have a [RESTful API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) \r\n2. Support [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)\r\n\r\nNot all storage providers have support for direct resumable uploads however we are implementing this feature where possible.\r\n\r\nFull resumable support is planned for:\r\n* [RackSpace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/)\r\n* [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\r\n\r\nWithout resumable support:\r\n* [Google Cloud Storage](http://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage.html) - Lacks CORS on chunked uploads\r\n\r\nNo support:\r\n* [Azure Blob Storage](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/data-management/) - Lacks CORS altogether\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nThe Condo project is being sponsored by the awesome people at [CoTag Media](http://cotag.me/) feel free to contact us projects@cotag.me","google":"","tagline":"Direct, resumable, cloud storage uploads"}
