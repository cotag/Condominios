{"name":"Condominios","tagline":"Direct, resumable, cloud storage uploads","body":"## Simple Scalability.\r\nThe Condo rails plugin was designed to simplify the process of uploading files to cloud storage providers in a scalable manner. It avoids the pitfalls of large file uploads that would otherwise pass-through an application instance or the need for a third party service.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/cotag/Condominios for integration details\r\n\r\n\r\n![Example App](https://raw.github.com/cotag/condo_example/master/doc/upload_screenshot.png)\r\nhttps://github.com/cotag/condo_example\r\n\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ruby and AngularJS\r\n\r\nCondo utilises the features of Ruby 1.9.x (compatible Rubies), Rails 3.x and the client side MVC of [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Browser\r\n\r\nCondo only works with browsers that support [XMLHttpRequest Level 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest)\r\n\r\nWe like it this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Cloud Storage\r\n\r\nWe are building drivers for providers that\r\n\r\n1. Have a [RESTful API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) \r\n2. Support [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)\r\n\r\n\r\nFull resumable support is available for:\r\n* [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\r\n* [Google Cloud Storage](http://cloud.google.com/products/cloud-storage.html)\r\n\r\nNo support (currently):\r\n* [RackSpace Cloud Files](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/public/files/)\r\n* [Azure Blob Storage](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/data-management/) - Lacks CORS altogether\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nThe Condo project is being sponsored by the awesome people at [CoTag Media](http://cotag.me/) feel free to contact us projects@cotag.me","google":"UA-35574967-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
